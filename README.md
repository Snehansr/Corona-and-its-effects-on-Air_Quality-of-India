# Corona-and-its-effects-on-Air_Quality-of-India

Our aim is to find whether Corona Virus had any impact on the Air Quality of the different cities of India.

The AQI calculation uses 7 measures: PM2.5(Particulate Matter 2.5-micrometer), PM10, SO2, NOx, NH3, CO and O3(ozone).

For PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx and NH3 the average value in last 24-hrs is used with the condition of having at least 16 values.

For CO and O3 the maximum value in last 8-hrs is used.

Each measure is converted into a Sub-Index based on pre-defined groups.

Sometimes measures are not available due to lack of measuring or lack of required data points.

Final AQI is the maximum Sub-Index with the condition that at least one of PM2 and PM10 should be available and at least three out of the seven should be available

How is AQI calculated?

The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its 24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health breakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location.

All the eight pollutants may not be monitored at all the locations. Overall AQI is calculated only if data are available for minimum three pollutants out of which one should necessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Else, data are considered insufficient for calculating AQI. Similarly, a minimum of 16 hoursâ€™ data is considered necessary for calculating subindex.

The sub-indices for monitored pollutants are calculated and disseminated, even if data are inadequate for determining AQI. The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air quality status for that pollutant.


For manual monitoring stations, an AQI calculator is developed wherein data can be fed manually to get AQI value.
